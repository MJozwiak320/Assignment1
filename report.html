        <h2>I designed a simple and colourful website to quickly give an overview of some of my skills and traits and what I can provide in terms of my course. I added a simple outline around the web page to make it stand out a bit more. I created 4 equal vertical sections that can change height depending on how much content is inside of them.</h2>
        <h2>I created a CSS file that changed the colour of each section and of the background of the whole page. Inside of the CSS file contained the code for the outline of the page as well. For each section I added images to help visualise my points better. I sourced the majority of them from Wikipedia while two pictures needed to be sourced locally.</h2>
        <h2>I added a table inside the skills section to neatly showcase some of my technical proficiencies.
